Classify it into one of the following two classes: 0. non-conspiracy. 1. conspiracy.\nText: All Warfare Is Based On Deception\r\n\r\nJesus reiterated this very important truth in Matthew 22:36-40, \u201cMaster, which is the great commandment in the law? Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind . This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself . On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.\u201d Deceivers don't love God or others! When Sean Hannity from Fox News spews his Zionist lies, he is deceiving the public! I remember in the years following the 911 attacks, that Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity helped whitewash the attacks, hiding THE TRUTH from the public, shunning anyone (e.g., the honorable former Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura, and former Georgia congresswoman Cynthia McKinney) who dared to question the U.S. government's bogus Official Story . The U.S. Justice Department is as crooked as a dog's hind leg, refusing to prosecute the true culprits behind 911.\r\n\r\nDeception is all around us! Churches are filled with heresies! Politicians lie to us at every election! Insurance companies lie by withholding vital information from people, burying it in fine print that only a legal expert can understand. When it comes time for an insurance claim, the insurance company adjuster brings out these cleverly hidden policies, denying the insured person's claim. Realtors and attorneys are notoriously dishonest, manipulating people with psychology in an effort to get them to do what they want. Christians are commanded to be honest and speak the truth, loving one's neighbour as thyself. This is THE GOLDEN RULE taught in Matthew 7:12, \u201cTherefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.\u201d Moses and all the Old Testament prophets, preached that God commands us to treat everyone the way we want to be treated. The Ten Commandments are based upon this truth. The first five commandments address Man's relationship with God, and the last five commandments address man's relationship with man.\r\n\r\nModern so-called \u201cchurches\u201d are emerging all across the world (especially in the United States)\u2014which are mere places of religious entertainment, shallow sermonettes lacking sound Bible theology, and social clubs promoting ideals of the New World Order (e.g., LGBTQ agenda, Zionism and a false social gospel). One man matters! One man can make a difference! I thank God for using a humble nobody like me to preach THE TRUTH!!!\r\n\r\n\u201cIt would be a godsend if the Church would suffer persecution today; she hasn't suffered it for hundreds of years. She is growing rich and lagging behind. Going back.\u201d \u2014 Evangelist Billy Sunday , The Need for Revivals, From \u201cBilly Sunday: The Man and His Message,\u201d by William T. Ellis, Philadelphia: John C. Winston Co., 1914\r\n\r\nThat is why we hear many young people nowadays claiming to be \u201cspiritual, but not religious.\u201d They have absolutely had it in disgust, for the disgrace and mockery that churches have become\u2014promoting 19 different Bible revisions, mistreating people, promoting another gospel, bidding Godspeed to heretics, and caring only about the love of money!!! Something is very wrong spiritually with churches today. I have also been mistreated by churches, simply for trying to be helpful, for telling THE TRUTH! ME TOO!\r\n\r\nProlific author George Orwell (1903-1950) rightly said: \u201cIn a time of universal deceit, telling THE TRUTH is a revolutionary act!\u201d It is tragic that most churches today have accepted the Devil's corruptible seed, being woefully misled concerning the inspired Word of God. Consequently, the churches are incrementally being TRANSFORMED (plotted against by occultists like Alice Bailey ) from being a place of theology to one of spirituality.\r\n\r\nYears ago I was watching the Catholic 'Eternal Word Television Network' (EWTN) and I heard a Catholic priest named John Corapi , boast that he absolved his father's sins before he died. How sad and tragic! Folks that man's father is tragically burning in the fires of Hell for ever and ever, having died in his sins, which no mortal man can forgive! You are a fool if you trust a Catholic priest to absolve your sins, when he cannot even absolve his own sins! ONLY GOD CAN FORGIVE SIN!!! No where in the Scriptures are we taught that God has delegated power to forgive sins to mortal man! What saith the Scripture? 1st Timothy 2:5, \u201cFor there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;\u201d People trust the Pope as God on earth; but I tell you truthfully that THE POPE IS A DOPE, AND HE HAS NO HOPE!!! Look what that queerbait Pope said! What a devil! Yeah buddy, you know it's true!!! Ephesians 5:11, \u201cAnd have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.\u201d\r\n\r\nI have to give the Devil credit for being slick. He sure has deceived the whole world, even the churches!!! Has your church or Bible college been deceived ? My point is not to criticize pastors, but to expose the dangers of the modern Bible revisions. Do you know why the Alexandrian Bible versions changed James 5:16 from \u201cfaults\u201d to \u201csins\u201d? It was likely because Brooke Westcott and Fenton Hort were extremely pro-Catholic , and were Mary worshippers!!! Catholics teach their victims to confess their sins to the ungodly priest. No Lutheran minister or Catholic priest can forgive sins, only God can forgive sin! Mark 2:7, \u201cWhy doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only ?\u201d The wicked heathen scribes understood that only God can forgive sins. Hence, we ought never confess our sins to anybody except God (1st John 1:9). By the way, Mark 2:7 is further proof that Jesus is almighty God, because He forgave sins as only God is empowered to!\r\n\r\nA \u201cfault\u201d is showing up late? A \u201cfault\u201d is lacking patience, as I do at times. A \u201cfault\u201d is lacking understanding. A \u201cfault\u201d is not paying attention better when people are talking. A \u201cfault\u201d is being selfish and eating all the food for yourself, not considering the next person. Those are faults! A \u201csin\u201d is a whole different ball game! The competent 54 King James Bible translators understood the difference! Pastor Jack Hyles got it right, who said: \u201cDon't be reluctant to admit to others that you have feet of clay, but never show them your feet!\u201d Folks, it is theological incompetence to teach church members to \u201cconfess your sins to each other\u201d! Why are pastors so foolish? Why are they so wicked that they don't care about THE TRUTH? It is human nature to go along with the crowd, no matter how wrong they are! But a Christian who walks with God stands for THE TRUTH, even if it means going against the whole crowd, as I am with Bob Jones University and Harvest Baptist Church on Guam. SHAME ON THEM ALL!!!\r\n\r\n\u201cForgive me brother, I had ten more dirty thoughts toward your wife today, and I enjoyed it, sorry!\u201d Do you really think that we are to confess OUR SINS to one another? You're a fool if you do! Here's what the Holy Bible really says...\r\n\r\n\u201cBrother, I am so sorry, I just lusted and commit adultery again with your wife, as she bent over to pick up a songbook she dropped. Forgive me, she is wearing a tight skirt today!\u201d I just quoted to you from their perverted Bible version! Hey, let's read James 5:16 in the English Standard Version (ESV) that Bob Jones University sanctions, uses, promotes and sells...\r\n\r\nEASY-TO-READ VERSION (ERV) - James 5:16, \u201c So always tell each other the wrong things you have done . Then pray for each other. Do this so that God can heal you. Anyone who lives the way God wants can pray, and great things will happen.\u201d\r\n\r\nSadly, I heard a former associate pastor of Harvest Baptist Church on Guam, teaching over their KHMG 88.1 FM radio station, errantly say that Christians should \u201cconfess their sins to each other.\u201d How does that even work? ... \u201cHey, brother, sorry, I just commit adultery in my mind with your hot wife!\u201d You'd be picking up your teeth! I mean, that is a sin, right? So where did that incompetent associate pastor at Harvest Baptist Church on Guam get that ridiculous idea? Look no further than the corrupt Easy-To-Read Version (ERV) that Harvest sanctions, uses, promotes and sells! ...\r\n\r\nRemember that all warfare is based on deception! Why do you think the Devil has corrupted the inspired Word of God, publishing literally hundreds of English Bible revisions to confuse everyone? The Devil doesn't change the Bible enough, so that most churchgoers reject it; but he changes God's Word enough to corrupt the reader's mind, particularly regarding the doctrine of Christ. This perversion has caused many spiritual miscarriages (people getting religion without the new birth) and deformed children (believers retarded in their spiritual growth).\r\n\r\nPlease don't misunderstand, we ought to hate sin and try with the Holy Spirit's power to avoid it at all cost! The very moment that a person gets saved (i.e., born again), they are no longer under the power and curse of God's LAW, they are immediately brought under the safety and security of God's GRACE forever. So when we sin as believers, God's GRACE MUCH MORE ABOUNDS! I love that so much!!! In other words, no believer's sins could ever exceed God's available grace that keeps us saved! Romans 5:20, \u201cMoreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound :\u201d If saved, always saved!!! Albeit, God still wants us to obey the law with a spirit of Christlike love, because we are saved, not to get or validate salvation. Romans 3:31, \u201cDo we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.\u201d No child of God has God's blessing nor permission to break the LAW, but if we do (even intentionally with a bad attitude of wanting to continue in sin), GRACE DOTH MUCH MORE ABOUND!!!\r\n\r\nIn total contradiction to what John MacArthur just said\u2014that salvation will \u201cCOST YOU\u201d\u2014the Bible says that along with the sacrifice of His only begotten Son, God the Father wants to \u201cGIVE US ALL THINGS\u201d! Romans 8:32, \u201cHe that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things ?\u201d Did you get that? God wants to give us ALL THINGS, especially to them that obey Him (which is why we can earn rewards for eternity - Matthew 6:19-20). My friend, heretics like Paul Washer and John MacArthur (and other false prophets) lay heavy burdens upon men's shoulders, requiring them to turn away from living in sin as a lifestyle (MP3 of Ray Comfort doctrinally corrupting a woman on an airplane) to get to Heaven. Dear reader, I don't care who you are, if you are saved, you still live a lifestyle of sinning! Oh yes we do! It is inevitable as long as we are trapped in the body of this flesh!\r\n\r\nSadly, Moody Ministries in Chicago honor and bid Godspeed to Mr. MacArthur, even publishing his heretical books! Tragically, Harvest Baptist Church on Guam have unjustly excommunicated me since 2014, for telling THE TRUTH that Dr. John MacArthur preaches \u201cANOTHER GOSPEL\u201d! That means that Harvest is cursed by God, just like Mr. MacArthur is cursed by God!!! I just shared with you a half-truth from Pastor MacArthur, who is correct that salvation cost God the Father His Son, and that it cost the Son of God His life; but he is telling a BIG LIE to say that salvation will COST YOU! Beware of this deadly half-truth!!! The Devil always mixes LIES with TRUTH, to conceal his lies. Revelation 12:19, \u201cAnd the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world : he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat a liar! What a false prophet! Dr. MacArthur is wrong!!! Salvation did cost Jesus His life, which is why it doesn't cost the recipient anything. The Bible is very clear in Ephesians 2:8-9, \u201cFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.\u201d The apostle Paul made very clear to the Galatians that salvation doesn't begin by grace, but then be perfected with works! Paul said salvation both begins and ends with GOD'S GRACE!!! Galatians 3:3, \u201cAre ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?\u201d Ray Comfort falsely teaches, as does Paul Washer and John MacArthur, that the only way to be saved is to repent (turn from sins, they say) and continue repenting (turning away from sinful ways) your entire life! Well, they are totally WRONG on the meaning of repentance ! To \u201crepent\u201d in the Bible simply means: \u201cto change one's mind.\u201d Repentance is a change of mind from wrong thoughts to believing the Gospel. It DOESN'T mean to forsake the sins in one's life\u2014that is manmade reformation! Pastor Harry Ironside (1876-1951) fully understood this great theological truth, as he explains in his excellent tract: \u201c WHAT IS THE GOSPEL? \u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t believe anyone who says it\u2019s easy to become a Christian. Salvation for sinners cost God His own Son; it cost God\u2019s Son His life, and it\u2019ll cost you the same thing...\u201d [emphasis added]\r\n\r\nJW's are a Satanic religious cult! It is absolutely IMPOSSIBLE for salvation to be a gift, and at the same time require effort on our part. How can something be a \u201cfree gift,\u201d and yet require human \u201ceffort\u201d? What false prophets! What lying deceivers! Do you see how a half-truth is so deadly? Who can argue with the fact that salvation is a free gift? That is a very true statement, but it is a demonic lie that effort is required on our part to be saved! If you simply BELIEVE you are saved. John 6:47, \u201cVerily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSalvation is a free gift from God. It cannot be earned. Yet it does require effort on our part.\u201d SOURCE: What Must We Do to Be Saved? - Jehovah's Witnesses Official Web Site\r\n\r\nOne of the most effective LIES is the HALF TRUTH, because in part (the part of the lie that is true), it can be defended with incontestable logic! Here is a perfect example of a HALF-TRUTH. This is an exact quote from the Jehovah's Witnesses' (JW's) website...\r\n\r\nThe Lord said that He had nothing to hide, so He \u201cSPAKE OPENLY TO THE WORLD.\u201d John 18:20, \u201cJesus answered him, I spake openly to the world ; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing .\u201d The Devil is a liar for a very horrifying reason\u2014because everything he does is evil, and therefore it must be kept hidden under cover of darkness!!! That is why Freemasonry is a very secretive organization, because their agendas are evil to the core! The same is true of the Satanic cult of Mormonism, which is closely associated with Freemasonry. These are organizations within organizations. Tragically, Freemasons rule over the United States, evidenced in part by The Washington Monument and other occult symbols adorning our nation's capital. Luciferians control America at the highest levels of government, which is why the corrupt U.S. Justice Department has refused to prosecute high crimes (Mena, 911, HSBC, et cetera), using \u201cnational security\u201d is their cloak for being complicit with crime and evil. Ecclesiastes 5:8 foretells and guarantees their doom! God will have the final word in all matters pertaining to humanity! 1st Corinthians 4:5, \u201cTherefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness , and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.\u201d\r\n\r\nSatan is a lying deceiver, a murderer, and has no truth in him. Ephesians 2:2, \u201cWherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience :\u201d The unsaved person is naturally susceptible to Satanic deception, because they do not have the blessed Holy Spirit of God within them as a believer does (1st Corinthians 2:14; 3:16-17). As the arch enemy of God and humanity, Satan recruits ungodly men and women through the LOVE OF MONEY (the root of all evil according to 1st Timothy 6:10), to do his evil bidding to deceive the masses. 2nd Corinthians 11:13-15, \u201cFor such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness ; whose end shall be according to their works.\u201d This is a remarkable passage of Scripture, teaching us much about our enemy, Satan, and his deceitful workers, ministers of unrighteousness. I am amazed how professed Christians fail to see the threat of false ministers, who tell LIES just like their father Satan. Pastor John MacArthur and Evangelist Ray Comfort immediately come to mind, who both teach the Devil's LIE of Calvinism (aka, \u201cLordship Salvation\u201d).\r\n\r\nAnother one of General Sun Tzu's military principles is: \u201cTo know your Enemy, you must become your Enemy.\u201d It is important that we know our enemy. The Christian has three enemies: The flesh , the world and the Devil . In this article I am focusing on our enemy, the Devil. The inspired Word of God informs us about our enemy. Speaking to a group of unsaved Jews, Jesus said in John 8:44, \u201cYe are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.\u201d Please pay close attention to what the Lord said about the Devil\u2014that he is a liar and the father of lying! You can tell when the Devil is lying, because his lips are moving! Our text Bible verse from Revelation 12:9 reveals that the Devil is now deceiving the whole world . Have you been deceived? If you are bidding Godspeed to, selling, or using any modern Bible revision , you have definitely been deceived!!!\r\n\r\nI read an interesting article today in Forbes magazine about one of history's greatest Chinese military generals named, Sun Tzu. His philosophy on how to win a war is summed up in these 31 pieces of advice, the most intriguing of which caught my attention: \u201c All Warfare Is Based On Deception .\u201d When I read that truth, I immediately thought about the hundreds of English Bible revisions, which are blatantly corrupt and dangerously deceitful. I also thought about the heresy of Lordship Salvation, which is a deadly Satanic deception. Dear reader, it is very true that all warfare is based on deception , and that includes the spiritual realm. Ephesians 6:12, \u201cFor we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.\u201d\r\n\r\nRevelation 12:19, \u201cAnd the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world : he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.\u201d\r\n\r\nSolving 911: The Deception That Changed The World (a needful .PDF book Christopher Bollyn)\r\n\r\nThe American people have been deceived time and time again, by criminals who've hi-jacked the White House. I am not only saying that, but former Georgia congresswoman Cynthia McKinney said that, and she is correct! Any honest person, who has paid attention to the news, facts and has a working brain, KNOWS that bombs brought down those buildings on September 11, 2001. I am amazed at the woeful ignorance of America's foolish and complicit pastors and clergy, who continue to propagate the myth that foreign terrorists were behind 911. The Luciferian elite who rule over America, were behind 911 (and Sandy Hook, and The 1995 Oklahoma City Bombing, and the LGBTQ agenda). Former 32 year New York firefighter veteran and fire investigator, Rudy Dent, in an interview truthfully called 911: \u201cAN INSIDE JOB\u201d! Yet, despite plain testimony from U.S. political leaders and veteran investigative firefighters, the dumbed-down American people have been indoctrinated by the lying newsmedia. You simply cannot trust anything the newsmedia reports!!!\r\n\r\nWhat really makes me sad is the apostate and indifferent Bob Jones University (BJU) crowd, who are as deceived as anyone, supporting Satan's corruptible seed. The modern corrupt Bible revisions are 10,000,000 times more dangerous of a threat than 911! The horrifying 911 attacks murdered 2,977 innocent people (343 of which were dedicated firefighters), but the Devil's modern Bible revisions are sending MILLIONS of people to Hell!!! Can you imagine temperatures soaring several hundred degrees, compelling you to jump out of a window 80 stories high, knowing that you will die? The perpetrators and conspirators behind 911 got away with the greatest terrorist attack ever on U.S. soil. The Bush administration are guilty as can be, and anyone familiar with the facts about 911 KNOW IT! How did they get away with it? They answer is that they used the ungodly lying newsmedia! The U.S. Justice Department refused to investigate. Freemasons control the highest department of every government office. Americans have all been deceived!!!\r\n\r\nDo you realize that a mother in Texas was just sentenced to 99 years in prison, for beating up her 2 year old daughter (who is expected by doctors to make a full recovery); yet no one involved in the 911 attacks have ever been arrested, and no legitimate investigation has ever been done by the U.S Justice Department! Former U.S. President George W. Bush (a shameful war criminal), and U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney (a shameful war criminal), have been granted immunity from prosecution for the illegal Iraqi War by the U.S Justice Department! What blatant injustice!!! Ecclesiastes 9:11, \u201cIf thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest regardeth; and there be higher than they.\u201d I cannot wait to see those monsters judged by God in eternity, for brutally murdering 1,455,590 innocent people in Iraqi, in addition to the 2,977 murdered Americans on 911! If that upsets you, then you are a horrible person who doesn't care about others. As far as I am concerned, those were my brothers and sisters, and mother and father, jumping 1,000 feet to their gruesome death on 911.\r\n\r\nThe CIA has a liaison working in Hollywood, who does nothing but make sure that brainwashing propaganda is put into the movies that Americans watch! So be careful not to buy into the lying propaganda, by either the lying newsmedia or lying Hollywood movies. Hundreds of popular movies portray 911 as being plotted out by Arab terrorists. THE TRUTH is always stranger than fiction!!!\r\n\r\nNothing is as strange as the disturbing truth that tens of thousands of churches today, are promoting Bible revisions corrupted and published by Satan! Truly, the love of money is the root of all evil. Every one of the updated Bible revisions are heavily marketed, protected by legal U.S. copyright, threatening court action against anyone who quotes more than 12 verses (50%) of the Epistle of Jude. I'm not kidding! Look at the legal information in front of any modern Bible revision (except the non-copyrighted King James Bible) and you'll read that you cannot quote more than 50% of any book of the Holy Bible, or you may be legally sued in court. God's Words cannot be copyrighted. Some shady publishers attempt to copyright the King James Bible, but it is only the added notes that are copyrighted, not the actual words of God. Anybody can print all the King James Bibles they want in their basement, and sell them, and no one can legally do anything about it!!! Praise God for His very pure words!!!\r\n\r\nKindly, Moody Bible Institute, Dallas Theological Seminary, Wheaton Bible College, Bob Jones University, Liberty University and every other religious institution that promotes the Devil's modern Bible revisions are doing a horrible injustice to people, deceiving them with corruptible seed! Just like people have been woefully deceived about the 911 attacks, so also have millions of churchgoers been horribly deceived concerning the inspired Word of God. My friend, God only authored ONE SACRED BOOK, not two, not 339, not 900! Today's hundreds of English Bible versions are based upon a completely DIFFERENT ancient translation than the inspired King James Bible. Any simple person can see a big problem with this picture.\r\n\r\nWhy do Bible colleges and pastors accept this DECEPTION? Well, the churches do because the Bible colleges do, and the Bible colleges do because they want to make money, which means they need to appear as \u201cnormal\u201d as possible to attract more students. Declaring to be \u201cKing James Bible only\u201d risks being labeled as \u201ca cult,\u201d and losing students who are FAR MORE INTERESTED in pursuing a money-making career, than serving God by pursuing and proclaiming THE TRUTH. That is why Bob Jones University lures in young girls to pursue nursing careers, and THE TRUTH is shown where to sit in the back row of their institution! Case in point, Harvest Baptist Church on Guam, a local church that provides careers for BJU graduates, but I was forced out of their church for telling THE TRUTH! They called me their \u201cenemy,\u201d but they are GOD'S ENEMIES!!! Pastor Jack Hyles (1926-2001) is right that the Alexandrian crowd are GOD'S ENEMIES!!! \u201cTHE BATTLE OF THE AGES\u201d (MP3, Dr. Jack Hyles). Bob Jones University and their graduates are GOD'S ENEMIES!!!\r\n\r\nPensacola Christian College (PCC) are also GOD'S ENEMIES, any time that their shallow interns bid Godspeed to the Bob Jones crowd! Ladies and gentleman, we have a big problem in our country! Satan is always trying to sneak lies into the churches, and our churches are succumbing to ecumenism. I see the old independent fundamental Baptist movement in America tolerating heresy, going along with other compromising Baptists who are turning apostate. Jesus warned that NO MAN can serve God and money!!! Luke 16:13, \u201cNo servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. .\u201d Friendships can lead you astray. I saw Pastor Bob Gray Sr. support heretic Johnny Nixon, based solely upon their friendship, and Pastor Gray Sr. (respectfully) went down a wrong path. Thankfully, Johnny Nixon is history! I love Dr. Gray and fully support him and his ministry. Pastor Gray is one of my heroes of the faith! But I criticize even my heroes when I think they are wrong doctrinally, which I know any truth-teller would respect! Sometimes I criticize Dr. Jack Hyles (my all-time hero of the faith), such as his teaching on the Shekinah Glory, which is Satanic in origin (a Zionist fraud). I am a friend to THE TRUTH! Dr. Bob Gray Sr. is right, who said:\r\n\r\nOne of the most important things I have learned as a Christian is to be loyal to truth and not to men. I learned that from Pastor Jack Hyles, as he mentions in the following sermon. In 1945, Pastor Hyles made these life-changing decisions:\r\n\u2022 None Nobody will ever tell me what to preach or where to preach.\r\n\u2022 None Money will never be an object in my ministry.\r\n\u2022 None I will always be a friend to my friends.\r\n\u2022 None I will be loyal to principles, and not to Institutions. In this sermon Dr. Hyles states:\r\n\u2022 I will make the decisions of my ministry on the basis of what I think is right only.\r\n\r\nI am far from perfect, but I am on the side of THE TRUTH, no matter who it offends. If I am wrong, then I should be refuted; but if I am right, then I must stand for what I believe to be right. We are all wrong sometimes, and right at other times. Even a broken watch is right twice a day! My prayer, hope and goal is to preach THE TRUTH! I am always seeking for THE TRUTH. I emphasize those words for a good reason, because TRUTH MATTERS!!!\r\n\r\nThat is why I am at war with the Bob Jones University camp, because they are pulling on the same rope as the Devil. I just gave Harvest Baptist Church on Guam a really bad review on Google, which people need to be warned about, lest they be corrupted by counterfeit Bibles and Lordship Salvation. Somebody's got to care! I'm standing alone on Guam, so be it, BUT I WILL STAND!!! Ephesians 6 - FIGHT, Then WITHDRAW, then STAND! (awesome preaching, Pastor Jack Hyles). The problem is not the taverns, brothels or abortion clinics across America, it in the fuddy-duddy Bible professors in corrupt Bible colleges like Bob Jones University, Faith Bible College And Theological Seminary, Moody Bible Institute, Dallas Theological Seminary and Hyles-Anderson College, who shake the faith of young people in the inspiration of the King James Bible!!! These apostate Bible colleges (and hundreds more) are training tomorrows deadbeat religious leaders! I say \u201creligious\u201d because there is nothing \u201cChristian\u201d about promoting corruptible seed. People are being woefully deceived by the Devil concerning the inspired Word of God. If you don't have a King James Bible, you don't have an inspired Holy Bible in the English language. What about other languages? If you don't speak another language, don't worry about it! Go be a troll in your hole somewhere else!\r\n\r\nRespectfully, I heard Pastor Clarence Sexton | MP3 (sermon by Dr. Bill Grady preached at Temple Baptist Church in 2006) use the argument that people of foreign languages don't have a King James Bible. Dr. Sexton was trying to downplay the claim that the King James Bible is God's inspired perfect Word for today. Kindly, that argument cannot be used to defend the corrupt Alexandrian text which brutally assault the Trinity and deity of the Lord Jesus Christ. We are at war over the Bible today, and it is tragic that Baptist pastors don't want to get involved with the fight. Since 2008, the First Baptist Church of Hammond, Indiana, has openly denied the inspiration of the King James Bible. It is wickedness! We don't need any more pastors today, we need men of God who are willing to die proclaiming THE TRUTH! I heard U.S. President Bill Clinton (1992-2000) sidestep a question about abortion, contending that even leading theologians cannot agree on the matter of abortion. Sadly, Mr. Clinton was right, because most clergy are not right with God, many not even born-again believers! Any genuine man who walks with God KNOWS that abortion is cold-blooded murder!!!\r\n\r\nAnd any genuine man who walks with God KNOWS that the King James Bible is verbally (Word for Word) inspired, and the hundreds of English modern Bible revisions are corrupted by Satan (because they all reduce Jesus' deity and Godhead). I wish I could get Bible preachers to wake up and realize the utter importance of Bible inspiration, and the Pandora's Box it opens when apostates claim that we do not have an inspired Word of God today! Pastor Jack Hyles is right\u2014if even one word in the Holy Bible is wrong, then it could be any one of them, and we cannot trust it!!! Don't you dare tell me that the King James Bible is preferred and the best, but it is full of errors! There is no wisdom for today's cowardly pastors to back away from \u201cTHE BATTLE OF THE AGES\u201d!!!\r\n\r\nPastors are chickens, afraid to be called \u201ca cult\u201d and shunned by the religious world for proclaiming the inspiration of the King James Bible. Call me \u201ca cult\u201d brother!!! I dare you to shew me where Pastor Clarence Sexton preaches the inspiration of the King James Bible. I haven't found it! This is what I have found! Today's pastors hold the irresponsible attitude that they are going to stay busy soulwinning, and stay out of the fight over the Word of God; but what they foolishly don't realize (or don't care to admit) is that there won't be any soulwinning in the next generation, because the modern Bible revisions are transforming the churches from that of promoting theology to spirituality, preparing the masses to receive the Antichrist! While candidating, I heard the new pastor of First Baptist Church of Hammond say that he thought it a bad thing, to criticize the various Bible revisions being used by baby believers!\r\n\r\nWhy is it that bad pastors today don't see the modern Bibles being used by baby believers, as deadly as antifreeze being fed to babies in a nursery? I'll tell you why\u2014because they don't see the threat! They don't see how dangerous these modern revisions are. Brother Lester Roloff saw it...\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Word of God is our only hope\u2014that's our only hope! This has been the generation of translations and abominations, and perversions, of the Word of God! It's been a long time; now when the Revised Standard Version came out, I stood against it before I knew what it was, because the wrong crowd heard of that, and the wrong crowd received it, and I knew it got too much publicity to be right! And I knew if the newspapers publicized something, it had to be wrong! And so I knew that the American people and a lot of American preachers\u2014they welcomed it into their house before they knew it was a rattlesnake!\u201d \u2014Brother Lester Roloff, a needful quote from the MP3 sermon titled, \u201c'THE LIVING BIBLE' EXPOSED!\u201d \u201cThe worst rattlesnake on this earth, is the man that twists or seeks to modernize, or take from or add to, the Word of God!\u201d \u2014Brother Lester Roloff, a needful quote from the awesome MP3 sermon titled, \u201c'THE LIVING BIBLE' EXPOSED!\u201d \u201cNow the serpent (there's your rattlesnake right there!)... question the Word of God... This has been the same generation questioning the Word of God. I'm sick of hearing about all the mistakes in the King James version! \u201cIt's not dependable\u201d [critics say]. It is! The night I got saved it was dependable! The night God called me to preach it was dependable! For 43 years, I've been preaching it and declaring it, and it's been dependable to rescue the perishing and care for the dying, and sober the drunkard, and to deliver the dope head! I've never found anything any better! And so you're not going to get me to raise a bunch of questions about the Word of God! When I say the 'Word of God,' I consider the King James Version the Word of God!!!\u201d \u2014Brother Lester Roloff, a needful quote from the awesome MP3 sermon titled, \u201c'THE LIVING BIBLE' EXPOSED!\u201d \u201cDid you realize tonight that we're living in a Godless nation, a Christless nation, a Bibleless nation?\u201d \u2014Brother Lester Roloff, a needful quote from the MP3 sermon titled, \u201c'THE LIVING BIBLE' EXPOSED!\u201d \u201cBut you see, the attitude of this generation is: If you got a lot of education, Boy we've got it made! I mean that's it; I mean, you're just super-duper! ... Any kind of education that doesn't strengthen your faith in Jesus is an abomination!!! And the average college graduate comes out with less faith and less fire, than he had when he went in. I'm talking about in the Christian schools, in the seminaries, and in the Bible schools across this country; now that ought not be!\u201d \u2014Brother Lester Roloff, a needful quote from the MP3 sermon titled, \u201c'THE LIVING BIBLE' EXPOSED!\u201d \u201cThey call it 'The Living Bible.' It's not the living Bible! Jesus said, 'I came that ye might have life.' There's no life in that thing! Anything Jesus is not in, is dead!!!\u201d \u2014Brother Lester Roloff, an excellent quote from the MP3 sermon titled, \u201c'THE LIVING BIBLE' EXPOSED!\u201d \u201cCan't you see what the Devil is seeking to do to our people today? Modernists and infidels have taken over the chore of rewriting the Bible, and say\u2014he goes ahead to say that\u2014'We have written a book that everybody can understand.' Dear friend, that's the most stupid statement a man could ever make! Nobody has ever understood all of God or all of God's Word!\u201d \u2014Brother Lester Roloff, a wonderful quote from the MP3 sermon titled, \u201c'THE LIVING BIBLE' EXPOSED!\u201d\r\n\r\nRespectfully, if Brother Lester Roloff was right, Bob Jones University is wrong! Respectfully, if Pastor Jack Hyles was right, Pastors' Jack Schaap and John Wilkerson are wrong! Respectfully, if Pastor Al Lacy was right, The Crown College is wrong! Pastor Lee Roberson (1909-2007) believed that the King James Bible is inspired...\r\n\r\nNo one used to question the inspiration of God's Word. Please consider dear reader, that if your pastor or religious professor denies the inspiration of the King James Bible, they fully agree with the infamous atheist, Voltaire, who said:\r\n\r\nWell, I'll be hogtied in the morning! Great fluffy biscuits and cornbread! Papa Johns Italian sausage pizza! Okay, I'll stop! Good night folks, need I say more? If you won't listen to a broken humble sinner like me, a nobody with a website, then please listen to the most notorious atheist in history, who said that destroying man's belief in the inspiration of the Holy Bible is the way to DESTROY CHRISTIANITY! Great Job in Hammond! Great Job at Crown College! Great job screwing things up at Bob Jones University! Is anybody listening to me? Does anybody care? I CARE! GOD CARES!!!\r\n\r\nOh, how my heart yearns for preachers to GET RIGHT WITH GOD, so they'll rise up as fervent men of God, and proclaim to the world that we have an INSPIRED, INERRANT, AND 100% HISTORICALLY TRUE, BLESSED AND UNQUESTIONABLY TRUSTWORTHY KING JAMES BIBLE today!!! Preach it! Love it! Claim it! Obey it! Thank God for the King James Bible\u2014a masterpiece of English literature; but moreover, they are the eternal unchanging Pure Words of almighty God!!!!!!! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll Warfare is Based On Deception!\r\n\r\nThere is a progression of apostasy! The Devil did the same thing to Eve in the Garden of Eden. Whereas God gave them a direct commandment in Genesis 2:16-17, the serpent came along in Genesis 3:1b and said: \u201cHATH GOD SAID?\u201d Likewise, the first step downward is for a church to question the inspiration of the King James Bible, and then deny it (as has the shameful First Baptist Church of Hammond, Indiana; and the Temple Baptist Church of Powell, Tennessee). TRUTH MATTERS! The next step downward is a tolerance of the Devil's counterfeit Bible revisions (as Pastor John Wilkerson horribly said: You don't want to offend those baby believers using the Devil's fake Bibles!). We're in trouble folks! The churches are dying spiritually! Oh, they're growing in numbers alright, but merely swelling as a rotting dead corpse! A church ceases to be a local New Testament church when the inspiration of the King James Bible is denied. How can God's Words not be inspired?\r\n\r\nWhat has changed from \u201cthe original autographs\u201d? What would be the purpose of God giving mankind His \u201cvery pure\u201d Words (Psalm 119:140), just to let flawed, sinful and mortal men corrupt those Words? Again, if you won't listen to my words, listen to what Voltaire said, and weep you foolish men who deny Bible inspiration! The pure Words which God has inspired are still inspired!!! If they are no longer inspired, then they absolutely CANNOT be God's Words, they are man's words!!! Sadly, that is exactly what nearly everyone involved in the Bible colleges, evangelism and the churches believe today\u2014that at best all we have are man's best attempt to translate copies of copies of ancient manuscripts from Hebrew, Greek, Chaldean into the modern language. Some of the King James Bible came from Latin and other languages. I'm tired of hearing preachers criticize the King James Bible, boasting of superior modern scholarship. Well then why hasn't anyone produced a more accurate translation today? In every single case, even where (e.g., the Modern English Version) the translators claim to have used the reliable Textus Receptus, but in fact, they render the SAME corruptions as the Alexandrian texts. You simply cannot trust Bible publishers today, who all want to make a buck! There is NOTHING wrong with the time-proven King James Bible!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nHave you been deceived friend? Throw your modern Bible revision in the garbage! If you have difficulty understanding the inspired King James Bible, then \u201cSTUDY\u201d as God commanded. Do you know that even the apostle Peter had trouble understanding the Bible? It is true! Read 2nd Peter 3:16-17. So if one of Christ's very own apostles had difficulty understanding certain Scripture passages, then what makes you special? What gives anyone the right to change the Word of God, in a wicked attempt to bring God's divine Words down to the level of mortal men, sinners deserving of eternal damnation in Hell fire? You fools, leave the Word of God alone!!!\r\n\r\nBrother Roloff is so right\u2014No one has ever understood all of the Bible, evidenced by the fact Peter couldn't understand some of the things written by the apostle Paul. Anytime that wicked men rewrite the Bible, so that the unsaved man can understand it all, they are no longer God's inspired Words! All warfare is based on deception. Do you think Satan fails to grasp that? Satan's greatest weapon is to DECEIVE people into living the Christian life, without ever being born-again. For the past century, Baptists have seen clearly that Mormons, Catholics, Jehovah's Witnesses, Lutherans, Church of Christ, and Seventh-Day Adventists are false religions of the Devil, who preach ANOTHER GOSPEL; but only in recent decades has it become blatantly clear, that more than half of all Baptist churches today are also teaching ANOTHER GOSPEL!!! If your church requires people to \u201cbe willing to turn away from sin\u201d to be saved (aka, Jack Chick's false gospel), you are preaching ANOTHER GOSPEL! You don't have to be willing to give up anything to be saved, not even your unbelief. Mark 9:24, \u201cAnd straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.\u201d You don't get saved by giving up your unbelief, but by BELIEVING in spite of it!\r\n\r\nLikewise, Pastor John MacArthur and Evangelist Ray Comfort are going straight to Hell when they die, who preach ANOTHER GOSPEL! What deceivers! I'm Sick Of This Lordship Salvation Mess! (MP3, Dr. Jack Hyles rips against Lordship Salvation lie!) Sadly, most pastors and church staff today merely want to make money, so truth doesn't matter to them. Pastor Jack Hyles thought THE TRUTH was worth fighting for, and he did fight, to the finish, until he went to Heaven at age 74 in 2001! I miss Brother Hyles!!! I was there in 1992 at Hyles-Anderson College, when Pastor Al Lacy taught a summer school seminary, on the inspiration of the King James Bible. Here are my class notes! What has changed in Crownpoint? I'll tell you, something has horribly changed in Hammond! Kindly, Dr. Hyles' incompetent successor, Pastor Jack Schaap, denied the inspiration of the Bible at Pastor's School in 2008, stabbing Pastor Hyles in the back and the heart, forever corrupting the church! Listen to Pastor Hyles for yourself, about becoming a custodian of one to protect the church against change! It all makes me sad! A group of proud men have hi-jacked First Baptist Church of Hammond, spitting on the greatest truth Pastor Hyles ever stood for\u2014THE VERBAL INSPIRATION AND ACCURACY OF THE KING JAMES BIBLE!!! Pastor Hyles wisely called it in 1994: \u201cTHE BATTLE OF THE AGES\u201d!!!\r\n\r\nI know that the folks in Hammond would like to forget all this and move on, but they started something, and have chosen to side against the INSPIRATION of the King James Bible, and it has to be addressed, because the world is watching! The King James Bible is 100% verbally inspired!!! It wasn't merely given to men by a process of inspiration, the words themselves inspired by God, each and every last one of them!!!!!!!\r\n\u2022 Bob Jones University shamefully denies the inspiration of the King James Bible!\r\n\u2022 Pensacola Christian College shamefully denies the inspiration of the King James Bible!\r\n\u2022 Faith Baptist Bible College And Theology Seminary (preacher's cemetery) shamefully denies the inspiration of the King James Bible!\r\n\u2022 Ambassador Bible College shamefully denies the inspiration of the King James Bible!\r\n\u2022 Clear Creek Baptist Bible College shamefully denies the inspiration of the King James Bible!\r\n\u2022 Moody Bible Institute shamefully denies the inspiration of the King James Bible!\r\n\u2022 Crown Bible College shamefully denies the inspiration of the King James Bible!\r\n\u2022 Hyles-Anderson College shamefully denies the inspiration of the King James Bible!\r\n\r\nThese are ALL apostate institutions today (and I could mention a hundred more), that have betrayed the inspired Word of God for the almighty dollar!!! They all believe that God inspired the men who wrote the Bible, but that was the end of inspiration. They think that imperfect men took it from there, and at very best all we have today is an imperfect manmade translation! This is what Hyles-Anderson College now shamefully believes since 2008! It is wrong!!! This is what Bob Jones University insanely believes! It is wrong!!! God PROMISED in Psalms 12:6-7 to preserve His \u201cPURE WORDS\u201d from that generation \u201cFOR EVER\u201d!!! That means we MUST have an inspired Holy Bible today! If I am to live \u201cby EVERY WORD that proceedeth out of the mouth of God\u201d (Matthew 4:4b), then have an every word Bible!!! Right? You know I am right! Pastor Jack Hyles clearly understood that truth!!! (MP3, \u201cHow We Got God's Word\u201d).\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, all of the modern Bible revisions completely corrupt and remove God's solemn promise (as I just showed you from Psalms 12:6-7), in a wicked attempt to justify having hundreds of English Bible PERversions!! THOSE UNGODLY DEVILS!!! What is wrong with professed Christians today??? Cowardly Baptist pastors all across America are terrified to go against their peers in the ministry, refusing to take a stand and dare proclaim the truth that: THE KING JAMES BIBLE IS INSPIRED!!! To do so is tantamount to committing theological suicide nowadays!!! Well, count me among the dead for Christ!!!\r\n\r\nThe man with two watches never knows what time it is! Likewise, millions of churchgoers are utterly confused today, not knowing which Bible to trust, or which message is correct? Is Acts 8:37 in the Bible or not? Did people bow or worship Jesus in Matthew 8:2? Does a north wind bring rain or drive it away in Proverbs 25:23? Did Jesus command Mary not to touch Him, or to stop holding onto Him in John 20:17? The money-hungry Bob Jones crowd couldn't care less, just so long as their paycheck clears! The Lord warned about serving mammon instead of God in Luke 16:13!!! Truth always becomes expendable when money becomes desirable! Don't look at me that way you sourpuss! You know I'm right! GET RIGHT WITH GOD ALL YOU APOSTATES AT BOB JONES!!! The world doesn't need more religious nurses, mechanics, attorneys, clowns, or what have you, it needs godly mothers, present papas, and inspired King James Bible PREACHERS!!!\nClass:\n", "input": "", "output": "1. conspiracy", "id": "C057a0", "truncated": false}
