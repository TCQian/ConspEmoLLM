{"instruction": "Task: Determine the relatedness between the text and the Coronavirus conspiracy theory. Classify it into one of the following three classes: 0. not related. 1. closely related. 2. broadly related.  Text: Back in December, there was an outbreak of Pneumonia in China. While this might not seem too alarming it is something we all need to be aware of.    According to WHO as of January 9th, this cluster of Pneumonia cases could have a driving cause behind it of a new coronavirus. This according to WHO was identified by Chinese Authorities after investigators conducted ‘gene sequencing of the virus.’ This they were capable of doing by using an isolate from one patient who had a positive sample.    WHO reported as follows on the topic:    Initial information about the cases of pneumonia in Wuhan provided by Chinese authorities last week – including the occupation, location and symptom profile of the people affected – pointed to a coronavirus (CoV) as a possible pathogen causing this cluster. Chinese authorities subsequently reported that laboratory tests ruled out SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, influenza, avian influenza, adenovirus, and other common respiratory pathogens.    Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses with some causing less-severe disease, such as the common cold, and others more severe disease such as MERS and SARS. Some transmit easily from person to person, while others do not. According to Chinese authorities, the virus in question can cause severe illness in some patients and does not transmit readily between people.    Globally, novel coronaviruses emerge periodically in different areas, including SARS in 2002 and MERS in 2012. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. As surveillance improves more coronaviruses are likely to be identified.    China has strong public health capacities and resources to respond to and manage respiratory disease outbreaks. In addition to treating the patients in care and isolating new cases as they may be identified, public health officials remain focused on continued contact tracing, conducting environmental assessments at the seafood market, and investigations to identify the pathogen causing the outbreak.    While more research is being done and will continue to be carried out we are not sure what the current status entails as is. The source, modes of transmission and so forth are something we are unsure of moving forth. That having been said, emerging cases in Thailand suggest this is spreading beyond China itself.    As of the 20th of this month, (January) The Wall Street Journal has reported that this newly identified virus has health officials concerned as it could be transmitted even quicker than expected. It seems the number of confirmed cases has in recent times tripled. So far at least 4 have died but many more are sick at the moment and it appears the virus is also making a way in South Korea as it appeared there for the first time this past Monday.    WSJ reported as follows on the topic:    The World Health Organization said that Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus plans to convene an emergency committee Wednesday to determine whether to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. The designation helps the WHO mobilize resources to prevent and combat the spread to other countries.    The WHO said Monday the spread of the disease was likely the product of “some limited human-to-human transmission occurring between close contacts.”    The outbreak is believed to have started in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where a number of infected patients were exposed to a large seafood and livestock wholesale market. Coronaviruses most commonly infect mammals, including pigs and cats, but can jump from animals to humans.    They can also then jump from one human to another. Some patients have said they didn’t visit the market and only came into contact with people in Wuhan. The Wuhan market is close to the city’s main railway station, an important travel hub in the center of the country.    Zhong Nanshan, one of China’s most highly regarded epidemiology experts who is leading an expert committee on the outbreak for China’s cabinet-level National Health Commission, urged heightened vigilance in a live interview on state broadcaster China Central Television Monday, citing the risk of human-to-human transmission.    “Right now is the time when we should increase alert,” said Dr. Zhong, who rose to national prominence nearly two decades ago as an authoritative voice during China’s fight against severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. In that outbreak, a similar coronavirus killed 774 people after its emergence in southern China beginning in late 2002.    This virus has even managed to make its way to the US as CNN reports that we have at least 1 confirmed case present. This patient is in isolation currently and has not been named however is located in Washington. While John Wiesman, secretary of health for the state of Washington told CNN that he believes the risk is low in regards to the public we should all be aware of this health issue currently going around and be quick to get checked out if we think we’re facing something of the sorts.    As we learn more updates will be made but if you’re noticing symptoms of Pneumonia don’t ignore them. For more on this please check out the videos below.

Classify it into one of the following three classes: 0. not related. 1. closely related. 2. broadly related.  Text: The surprise announcement by JP Morgan that it lost $2 billion in trading derivatives was portrayed in some mainstream media outlets as no big deal. The Associated Press reported Friday, “Bank stocks were hammered in Britain and the United States on Friday, partly because of fear that a surprise $2 billion trading loss by JPMorgan Chase would lead to tougher regulation of financial institutions. . . .”The portfolio has proved to be riskier, more volatile and less effective as an economic hedge than we thought,” CEO Jamie Dimon told reporters on Thursday. “There were many errors, sloppiness and bad judgment.” (Click here to read the complete AP story.)    I think the market thinks this $2 billion surprise loss is much more than fear of “tougher regulation,” or that it was just “sloppiness and bad judgment.” Remember MF Global and its bankruptcy on Halloween last year? It, too, was trading in risky derivatives, and it lost $6 billion that wiped out the firm along with $1.6 billion in segregated customer cash. In the aftermath, we still do not know where the customer money is, but we did find out MF Global was leveraged 40 to 1. It would be hard to believe other big banks were not leveraged in risky derivative trades the same way. This is why traders on CNBC were hitting the panic button last week. Joe Terranova said, “I will dump my Bank of America on this news.” Other traders on the show were equally scared. “I can almost guarantee it’s not just JPMorgan,’ added trader Guy Adami. ‘JPMorgan looks like it’s going to bring down the entire space,’ said Steve Grasso.” (Click here for the complete CNBC story.)    The only way JP Morgan could “bring down the entire space” is if the entire space was leveraged in ways similar to JP Morgan. Of course, no U.S. bank has more derivative exposure than JP Morgan. According to the Comptroller of the Currency, JP Morgan has a little more than $70 trillion in total derivative exposure. (4th quarter 2011 OCC report) The next 4 commercial banks have a combined $150 trillion (approximate) in total derivative exposure. I am sure the banks will tell you that this is all hedged (bilaterally netted) to minimize any losses, but we all know how well that strategy worked with AIG, Lehman and MF Global.    I am not the only one worrying about JP Morgan’s $2 billion dollar surprise trading loss. Friday, one of the big debt ratings companies downgraded the troubled bank’s debt. CNN reported, “The closing bell brought no relief for JPMorgan Chase on Friday, as a major credit rating agency moved to downgrade its debt almost exactly 24 hours after the bank revealed a $2 billion trading loss. Fitch Ratings downgraded both JPMorgan’s short-term and long-term debt, with the latter falling to A+ from AA-. The bank, the country’s largest by assets, was also placed on ratings watch negative. Fitch said it views the $2 billion loss as “manageable” but added that “the magnitude of the loss and ongoing nature of these positions implies a lack of liquidity.” (Click here for the complete CNN.com story.)    With the “ratings watch negative,” it doesn’t appear that JP Morgan’s derivative troubles are over, does it? Renowned money manager and investor Rick Rule thinks what happened to JP Morgan could not just bring down the bank but the entire financial system in a replay of the 2008 meltdown. In an interview Friday with King World News, Rule said, “There would seem to be a mismatch of some amount of money in the $100 billion range between credit default swaps. They seem to have been net sellers or providers of about $100 billion in unhedged credit default swaps. When I say seems, these are extremely complex instruments. Investors should be aware that derivatives such as these can bring down the entire banking system. . . . It’s just an example of the potential black swans that exist in a very, very leveraged banking environment.” (Click here to read and hear the complete KWN interview with Rick Rule.)    I am not saying that JP Morgan is going out of business anytime soon, but if the bank does get in to more trouble and there are more losses, how much will it cost to save them? What if the other big banks are in the same spot? Does there come a time when the big banks are no longer too big to fail but too leveraged to save? Did JP Morgan just turn into a black swan?

It was a false flag operation run by globalist factions in our government to try and grab our guns. It must have been very challenging for the medical examiner, Wayne Carver, to keep pushing back the truth and FOIA requests – that no children died and that no death certificates could ever be produced.    Actually, Lisa-the-whore-traitor, patriots want to see ALL the texts you and Peter had with one another on your GOVERNMENT phones.

The street light was given to him by British patriots and came from an unknown location. Steele examined the light unit and someone made a video recording of him doing so. The 5G street light/weapon was then returned to its pole. In the video below, the authorities have come to speak to Mark about his “crime”.    The Leo Zagami Show Featuring the one and only John Barnwell…oh yeah, and Roseanne Barr, too.    As you watch the video inside the headline link below, keep in mind that the intelligence community is no friend of President Trump’s. They are the opposition and outright LIE to the President to push their globalist agenda of never-ending war and strife. As AIM patriots have learned over the last few months, the U.S. IC is actually controlled by British FIVE EYES. Ask Gina Haspel…she was the London CIA director and was down with the coup plans.    So the DNC and State Dept was corrupt in Ukraine laundering money. Then they colluded with steel for the dossier. The FBI colluded with Deripaska for the black ledger. The FBI leaked the bogus story to the press. Used the story in the press to show the FISA court that the story was credible. Leaked the investigation to the press to “dirty up trump”. When TRUMP wins . the FBI/Justice Dept collude with Mueller. And when that didn’t work. Mueller inc. Colludes with the Dems in the house to impeach the president. And nothing from Pompeo. Nothing from Barr. The Senate is corrupt. The media is corrupt. The Rino’s are corrupt.    HOW THE HELL IS PRESIDENT TRUMP STILL HERE?

You don’t wind up on Mexico’s border, having traveled from Africa, just because you are “huddled masses yearning to breathe free.” And, I’m sorry to say, the “loopholes” in American law are really no coincidence.
