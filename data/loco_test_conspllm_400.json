American researchers have managed to grow a SARS vaccine in genetically engineered tomatoes, reporting that mice fed the tomatoes developed antibodies to the coronavirus that killed nearly 800 people in 2003. Their findings, published Tuesday in the medical journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, drew interest from others in the scientific community. But experts were quick to caution that vaccine-laden produce isn't heading to your dinner plate anytime soon. \"There's still a long ways to go between knowing whether this is a promising lead and conducting further research or whether other forms of technology would be more likely to be useful,\" said Dr. Bob Brunham, director of the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control. Dr. Brunham noted the scientists, from Thomas Jefferson University's Biotechnology Foundation Laboratories, reported only that the mice fed the vaccine-filled tomatoes developed antibodies. They did not report on whether they \"challenged\" the mice with the virus to see if those antibodies were the type needed to actually protect against the disease. The simple presence of antibodies can't be assumed to be protective. \"They didn't show ... that their antibodies would neutralize a virus in tissue culture,\" said Dr. Brunham, who co-chairs the SARS accelerated vaccine initiative or SAVI, a project established in Canada following Toronto's deadly experience with the since-disappeared disease.

Dr. Wittkowski has some very interesting things to say, which indicate that the Gates-inspired lockdown/social distancing strategies are merely designed to prolong the natural spreading of the disease and the acquisition of natural immunity. Further, peak infection in certain countries had largely occurred before the lockdowns were pointlessly imposed anyway:\r\n\r\nAs with every respiratory disease, we should protect the elderly and fragile because when they get pneumonia, they have a high risk of dying of the pneumonia. So that is one of the key issues that we should keep in mind. On the other hand, children do very well with these diseases. They\u2019re evolutionarily designed to be exposed to all sorts of viruses during their lifetime, and so they should keep going to school and infecting each other.

Of course, Loudon County is home to the \"Bell labs of biotech\" namely Howard Hughes Medical Institute and many other biotech companies, including Ken Alibek's. Perhaps, hospitals had been equipped with BSL 4 features because it was feared a pathogen might escape one of the labs. The SARS patient from Loudon County was treated and cared for in the hospital's isolation room attended by staff using BSL 4 equipment.

Your suspicion is easily confirmed if you read up on the first church in Jerusalem under the apostles. Instead of having a reputation for being judgmental, self-righteous hypocrites like Christians too often have, the Jerusalem believers had love, public favor and esteem (Acts 2:46-47; 42-45; John 10:35; Acts 5:13). Frankly, it's a bit depressing when you read those passages and realize how far off the mark the Christian church is today compared to the original. Why such a big difference? It's simple: Jesus trained his disciples in necessary fundamentals which the Jerusalem church learned directly from them (Mt 28:20; Act 2:42). Since we don't have Jesus' trained apostles anymore and the Bible is not exactly in a clear, tutorial format, what do we do? Imagine that if as soon as you became a believer you were handed a workbook teaching you the fundamentals for serving God. Such a workbook would finally answer what God wants of us (and why!) along with other common, big questions all believers can't get good answers to from Christianity.

From the time Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome reached U.S. shores in March the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has used a broader definition than other countries in a bid to catch anyone who might spread the disease. But CDC Director Dr. Julie Gerberding said this was confusing people. \"I think we did cast a very wide net early on. We know that we have more people in the net than truly have SARS,\" she told a news briefing. \"We have a test available now and that is going to help us sort out the cases truly related to coronavirus,\" she said. \"We do not want to exaggerate the scope of the problem here.\" The World Health Organization reports more than 3,200 people have been infected with SARS and 159 have died. But there are many more suspect cases and WHO says in China, where the epidemic started last November, there may be five times more cases than have been officially reported. One stumbling block was uncertainty over the cause of SARS, so health officials have been forced to define the illness by its symptoms, which include fever, a dry cough and a certain pattern of pneumonia as seen in an X-ray. The CDC said probable cases would now be defined as patients who had developed pneumonia, while suspect cases would have fever, cough and recent travel to affected parts of Asia or contact with a suspected SARS patient. Now the SARS virus has been identified, tests are being issued to detect the virus in patients and speed\nClass:\n", "input": "", "output": "0. non-conspiracy", "id": "C00ecf", "truncated": true}

The scientists in his team discovered that the coronavirus is optimized for penetration into human cells, rather than animal cells, which means that the theory that it emerged from an animal market and jumped to humans naturally is unlikely.\r\n\r\nLifesite News reports that the scientists \u201cused a version of the novel coronavirus collected in the earliest days of the outbreak and applied computer models to test its capacity to bind to certain cell receptor enzymes, called \u201cACE2,\u201d that allow the virus to infect human and animal cells to varying degrees of efficacy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey found that \u201cthe novel coronavirus most powerfully binds with human ACE2, and with variously lesser degrees of effectiveness with animal versions of the receptor.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe authors believe this means that the virus \u201cbecame specialized for human cell penetration by living previously in human cells, quite possibly in a laboratory.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Study notes that \u201ca virus would be expected to have highest affinity for the receptor in its original host species, e.g. bat, with a lower initial binding affinity for the receptor of any new host, e.g. humans.

Or, you may want to avoid them for a whole slough of other reasons including harmful ingredients, the use of genetic materials from aborted babies, or simply credible distrust of our institutions.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we don\u2019t even know if a vaccine would work, or if the virus mutates quickly enough to avoid detection like the common cold.\r\n\r\nWhether or not you believe in vaccination, it\u2019s hard to deny the importance that government respects our bodily rights.

But that number is a dramatic overcount. Our metrics include deaths that have nothing to do with the virus. The problem is even worse as the Centers for Disease Control over counts even some of these cases and the government has created financial incentives for this misreporting. Relying on these flawed numbers is destroying businesses and jobs and costing lives.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe case definition is very simplistic,\u201d Dr. Ngozi Ezike, director of Illinois Department of Public Health, explains. \u201cIt means, at the time of death, it was a COVID positive diagnosis. That means, that if you were in hospice and had already been given a few weeks to live, and then you also were found to have COVID, that would be counted as a COVID death. It means, technically even if you died of clear alternative cause, but you had COVID at the same time, it\u2019s still listed as a COVID death.\u201d\r\n\r\nMedical examiners in Michigan use the same definition. In Macomb and Oakland Counties, where most of the deaths occurred, medical examiners classify any deaths as Coronavirus deaths when the postmortem test is positive.

No company, it seemed, could figure out how to fix the ice making problem, having spent $13 million dollars and six years in a vain attempt to get it working again. It rapidly became a national joke.

Who killed more people, Hitler, Stalin or Mao?\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, Chairman Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is the frontrunner with estimates ranging from 45 to over 60 million people murdered, starved, or worked to death under his iron fist.\r\n\r\nMao\u2019s CCP lives on as a modern capitalistic, technocratic, authoritarian regime, and aside from general information about what life is like for the average Chinese citizen, we in the free world really don\u2019t know what true authoritarianism is like.\r\n\r\nIn recent years we\u2019ve been able to learn about some of the more outrageous social controls in Chinese society, like social credit scores, heavy internal censorship of the internet, the occasional mass public execution, and the ubiquity of facial recognition technology to monitor ordinary people.\r\n\r\nNot since Tiananmen Square has the world really bothered to criticize Chinese authoritarianism, and even those who\u2019ve been fighting for decades to stop the persecution of the Falun Gong have faced an uphill battle against Chinese public relations efforts.\r\n\r\nRecently, however, massive protests in Hong Kong have brought attention to the daily injustices of everyday life under modern communism.

Every tragedy, no matter how terrible, should be absorbed into the public consciousness and adopted as a cautionary tale; a part of our mythos. These events should not be cast into the memory hole to make life less stressful, they need to be taken seriously. Otherwise, the damage done and the lives lost are all for nothing.\r\n\r\nRefusing to examine the dark side of life and its dangers has become a staple of our society, to the point that it has given birth to a kind of religious cult. Naive optimism has become a virtue, a misplaced form of faith that encourages people to remain oblivious in the face of adversity. And the more precarious our system becomes, the more these people see unicorns and rainbows. It is truly bizarre.\r\n\r\nSome of us understand the mechanics of our economic, political and social machine and recognize that they are broken. The system cannot be fixed because it has been corrupted by people with evil intent (globalists); it is designed to fail. The agenda? To crash almost everything and then replace it with a centralized behemoth, a global empire. The intent is to force the masses to accept this \u201cnew world order\u201d using a false choice \u2013 We can have chaos and death, or \u201corder\u201d through total Orwellian control.

This hugely significant event occurred almost 60 years ago, officially from the 16th to the 28th of October 1962.\r\n\r\nWhile humanity will eventually recover from the coronavirus outbreak, the missile crisis confrontation between America and the USSR came close to destroying our planet. The factors culminating in it were, overwhelmingly, due to American aggression and terror pursued by the John F. Kennedy administration against revolutionary Cuba. Perhaps most serious of all, as the missile crisis was peaking on 26 October 1962, president Kennedy was handed a vital letter in the early evening, written by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev.\r\n\r\nMore than 100 US-built missiles having the capability to strike Moscow with nuclear warheads were deployed in Italy and Turkey in 1961. (Public Domain)\r\n\r\nIn Khrushchev\u2019s lengthy correspondence to JFK, among other things he offered to end the missile crisis with a simultaneous public withdrawal of Soviet nuclear missiles from Cuba, along with the removal of US Jupiter missiles placed in Italy and Turkey, the latter country close to Soviet borders. The Kremlin, we can note, posed no threat of invasion to NATO state Turkey, nor was Moscow directing a major terrorist campaign against Turkey either.\r\n\r\nPresident Kennedy was aware that if he refused Khrushchev\u2019s offer, it would lead to an estimated 33% to 50% increased chance of nuclear war erupting between America and the Soviet Union.

In about a month since news about a new strain of coronavirus escaped from the Communist country, the number of infected is spiking upward with more reported deaths.\r\n\r\nThe newest coronavirus first appeared in the central Chinese province and city of Wuhan in Hubei, a city with four times as many residents as Chicago, Illinois. The pathogen spreads easily by human contact and produces symptoms similar to an upper respiratory condition such as pneumonia.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, January 23, 2020, 17 people (most of them elderly, aged 60 and above) in Wuhan and Hubei province to the north as of late January 23 had been reported killed from the disease. At that time, 617 cases of this novel respiratory infection had been logged in China.\r\n\r\nToday, Friday, January 24, Chinese sources have disclosed the new numbers after only 24 hours: 850 diagnosed in China and at least 26 dead.\r\n\r\nSuspected as Ground Zero for this viral tide are the wholesale markets in Wuhan where raw fish are sold next to dead animals, creating conditions where parasites and germs can flourish and mutate.\r\n\r\nThe Wuhan coronavirus spread quickly across the local seas and straits to Thailand, Japan, and South Korea.

Top researchers from 13 different laboratories around the world announced they had pinpointed the coronavirus as the cause for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). \"These colleagues have come to consensus agreement that we can now say that the disease called SARS first reported on March 12 is being caused by the coronavirus,\" chief researcher Klaus Stohr told journalists in Geneva. He said the confirmation would allow them to refine diagnostic tests and steer a clear path to fight the disease, although another member of the team said it would take \"months to years\" to develop a full treatment. The breakthrough was a rare ray of sunshine on an otherwise bleak day, with nine more deaths reported in Asia and the travel sector bracing for a grim Easter weekend. Five deaths were announced in Hong Kong, where the respiratory illness has killed 29 people in the past five days alone, with another three in Singapore -- the city-state's biggest daily toll yet. One more victim in China brought the total confirmed global death toll from the virus to 161. However, the real toll could be far higher after the WHO implicitly accused the Chinese authorities of covering up the epidemic in the capital Beijing, thereby casting doubt on all the official Chinese SARS figures. Since being criticised for not coming clean about the virus when it first emerged in the southern province of Guangdong in November, China has repeatedly insisted the epidemic was under control and belatedly started making public\nClass:\n", "input": "", "output": "0. non-conspiracy", "id": "C039b6", "truncated": true}

Sanctions cause much pain and suffering and even death on a wide scale. One would have thought that given what the global Coronavirus pandemic has wrought in the US, its elite would seek to lift sanctions it has imposed upon societies determined to protect their independence and sovereignty.\r\n\r\nBy looking at three well-known victims of US sanctions, we shall show how the coronavirus crisis has helped to bring to the fore some of the issues that challenge them. Iran has been under comprehensive sanctions which have become increasingly harsh since 1980. There is no need to emphasise that it is because Iran after the Islamic Revolution of February 1979 refused to yield to US dictates and chose to champion the Palestinian cause through deeds rather than words that it found itself the target of the superpower of the day. Iran has made it very clear that though it is going through great difficulties as a result of the Coronavirus it will not accept any assistance from the US unless the US lifts the sanctions. It has however applied for financial help from the IMF which according to some sources has been blocked by the US government that exercises considerable influence over that multilateral institution. China and other countries from the European Union have come to Iran\u2019s aid.\r\n\r\nIt is significant that citizens\u2019 organisations in Iran have extended a hand to the poorer segment of US society which is bearing the brunt of the pandemic that has now crippled the country.

ACE2 (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2) has been shown to be one of the major receptors that mediate the entry of 2019-nCoV into human cells, which also happens in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS). Several researches have indicated that some patients have abnormal renal function or even kidney damage in addition to injury in respiratory system, and the related mechanism is unknown.\r\n\r\nThis arouses our interest in whether coronavirus infection will affect the urinary and male reproductive systems. Here in this study, we used the online datasets to analyze ACE2 expression in different human organs. The results indicate that ACE2 highly expresses in renal tubular cells, Leydig cells and cells in seminiferous ducts in testis. Therefore, virus might directly bind to such ACE2 positive cells and damage the kidney and testicular tissue of patients. Our results indicate that renal function evaluation and special care should be performed in 2019-nCoV patients during clinical work, because of the kidney damage caused by virus and antiviral drugs with certain renal toxicity. In addition, due to the potential pathogenicity of the virus to testicular tissues, clinicians should pay attention to the risk of testicular lesions in patients during hospitalization and later clinical follow-up, especially the assessment and appropriate intervention in young patients\u2019 fertility.\nClass:\n", "input": "", "output": "0. non-conspiracy", "id": "C049db", "truncated": false}

China, after initially suppressing news of the outbreak in Wuhan, used its arsenal of surveillance tools to tackle the pandemic. These techniques ranged from deploying hundreds of thousands of neighborhood monitors to log the movements and temperatures of individuals, to the mass surveillance of mobile phone, rail, and flight data to track down people who had traveled to affected regions. But democratic countries in East Asia also used expansive surveillance powers to battle COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. South Korea harnessed closed-circuit television (CCTV) and credit card data to track the movements of individuals, and Taiwan integrated health and other databases so all Taiwanese hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies could access the travel information of their patients.\r\n\r\nAs they struggle to contain the spread of the virus, Western liberal democracies are looking to China\u2019s tools for limiting the outbreak and wondering whether they should adopt some of those authoritarian methods.

Many people have strongly criticized the industry\u2019s response for waiting too long to implement safety precautions and close processing plants as thousands have tested positive for coronavirus and at least 20 workers have died. But the inspectors checking these facilities and their products are not immune to the virus either.\r\n\r\nFSIS inspectors are classified as essential workers, so they have continued to travel to monitor these facilities. But as the plants become coronavirus hot spots, reports have shown the inspectors haven\u2019t been able to protect themselves adequately.\r\n\r\nA FSIS inspector interviewed in Government Executive said moving inspectors exposed to an outbreak at one plant to another location isn\u2019t safe because they could then be coronavirus carriers and further the spread.\r\n\r\nLast month, Politico reported many of the inspectors were expected to find their own protective gear since USDA wasn\u2019t able to secure face masks for all of its workers. In April, USDA said it would give a $50 reimbursement for inspectors to find their own, according to Politico. But now the department says it has enough masks.\r\n\r\nSince more than 300 inspectors have either tested positive or self quarantined, that can make it challenging to inspect every plant.

All of this, we\u2019re told, is for our own good.\r\n\r\nThe most egregious example of this outpouring of authoritarianism was an attempt by Louisville, Kentucky, Mayor Greg Fischer to ban drive-in church services on Easter. On Holy Thursday, one day before Christians were to begin their most important religious celebrations of the year, Fischer declared that drive-in Easter services would be illegal.\r\n\r\nTo remove all doubt about his seriousness, he also threatened arrest and criminal penalties for anyone who dared violate his order, and in an Orwellian twist, invited people to snitch on their fellow citizens. Fischer justified this by saying it was \u201cto save lives.\u201d\r\n\r\nThankfully, a federal judge made short work of the mayor\u2019s idiotic power-grab, issuing a temporary restraining order against the city of Louisville on Saturday, writing so as to remove all doubt, \u201cThe Mayor\u2019s decision is stunning.

Be certain you\u2019re doing nothing wrong to study prophecy which is actually something encouraged in the Bible.\r\n\r\nYou might think that studying Bible prophecy is a sin given the negative opinions Christians have on the subject. In fact, if you are interested in Bible prophecy, you've probably learned to keep it to yourself so you are not judged or criticized by others over it.

They may not want you to study it or at least not to bring it up in conversation at church (what if a new believer hears and gets confused or deceived by it?). If you do bring it up, you may be rebuffed with one of several common criticisms of Bible prophecy.\r\n\r\nThanks to my website, I get to hear these objections all the time outside of church.

The coronavirus has the potential of being the \u2018trigger\u2019 which will push the world into a global depression.\r\n\r\nHere, we briefly explain why.\r\n\r\nIt looks that the virus spreads very easily, through droplet infection and with a \u201clatency\u201d period that allows infected people to spread the virus before they themselves exhibit symptoms. This implies that the virus has already spread much more widely than original estimates indicate. The individual cases popping up across the globe are one confirmation of this.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the fatality rate is still relatively low: under 2 percent. However, this can change, especially if the virus mutates, and there\u2019s already speculation, whether the figures provided by China can be trusted.\r\n\r\nAs we have been warning through 2019 (see, e.g., this and this), China\u2019s economy is ripe for a serious downturn. Beijing used most of its remaining firepower last year, when it desperately tried to postpone the inevitable recession, probably to appear strong in the trade negotiations.\r\n\r\nDespite record-breaking stimulus enacted in 2019, the Chinese economy has grown at a sub-par rate of around six percent. And this is according to the official statistics! In reality, the actual Chinese growth rate has probably been much lower.\r\n\r\nAs China\u2019s State-Owned Enterprises, or \u201cSOEs\u201d, have become riddled with debt, their ability to increase production has stagnated.

While most of these guidelines cover things like essential survival skills and what kinds of supplies to stock up on, there are also mistakes that you must avoid so you can survive when SHTF.\r\n\r\nIf you want to survive something like the coronavirus pandemic, pay attention to the 10 mistakes detailed below.\r\n\r\nDuring dangerous times, smaller mistakes can snowball into tragedies that can even claim lives.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the safety of your loved ones, keep yourself from making common prepping mistakes by practicing your skills, using your common sense and being disciplined. Acknowledge these common mistakes, and optimize your preps, so you don\u2019t make the wrong choice when time is of the essence.\r\n\r\nActing decisively is different from acting rashly. The latter can get you killed, but the former involves studying the data you have, reconsidering your options and making a decision based on the pros and cons.\r\n\r\nPreppers are planners. From your garden layout to your bug out and bug in plans, you need to sit down and draft your plans before finalizing and setting up your preps.\r\n\r\nOnce you\u2019ve written down your plans, think of how things can go wrong and make plan B, so you have a backup when plan A fails.\r\n\r\nYour skills are important, but being prepared means you\u2019ve already won half the battle.\r\n\r\nTake this scenario: You\u2019re going camping, but you didn\u2019t pack several firestarters in your gear.

To survive the crisis, the West becomes less and less \u201cwestern\u201d, progressively denying its liberal and globalist values \u200b\u200bof open society, open borders and free markets, promoting increasingly constant and incisive state interventions, closing borders and instituting strong economic protectionism.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate some of the partial effects of the crisis, we can mention some official data. Federal Reserve System\u2019s President James Bullard recently announced that 46 million people are expected to lose their jobs in the United States. The speculation concerns precisely the positions in which employees work interacting with the public. These jobs are suspended indefinitely by the sanitarian rules, which damage the income of millions of people and require a quick government attitude to guarantee a universal basic income.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, banks have already anticipated the recession and Europe's largest economy is experiencing its greatest instability in recent decades. With the overwhelming growth of the infection in the country, there is no other measure than the implementation of the quarantine and the strong action of the State to repair the economic crisis that will result from the isolation. \"The coronavirus pandemic will trigger a severe downturn in Germany's economy and recession is inevitable (...)

Although things are really bad for millions right now due to the effects of lockdown, economist Mariana Mazzucato believes that the Covid-19 crisis will shine light on societal and economic systems all across the world, exposing some of the deep-rooted flaws of capitalism.\r\n\r\nAfter lockdown ends, Mazzucato believes societies can be reshaped to become more inclusive.

For instance, it has long been believed that comets formed when the planets came to be, billions of years ago. But new research shows that this is not necessarily true of all comets.\r\n\r\nJust look at the 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, an oddly-shaped, double-lobed comet most famous for being the destination of the Rosetta mission. Also known as 67P, this comet is highly unique in that its bizarre shape may be the result of two comets merging. Not only is this indicative of its younger age (meaning that it was not created during the birth of the Solar System, like most other comets), but being a fusion points to 67P arising from a relatively gentle union between comets.\r\n\r\nHow this came about is what an international team of researchers sought to answer. They ran numerical simulations that showed what would happen if celestial bodies of varying sizes collided at different angles and speeds. The simulations, which were conducted at the M\u00e9socentre Sigamm at the Observatoire de la C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur in Nice, France, revealed that comets crashing into one another at speeds of 2,200 mph would not result in the destruction of both comets. Instead, only a small amount of it would disintegrate into dust. (Related: Asteroid strike near New York City would kill 2.5 million people, reveals physics simulation based on NASA data.)\r\n\r\nThe portions of the comet opposite from the impact would withstand the collision.

The preamble to the bill read, in part:\r\n\r\nThere is a large body of scientific research establishing a connection between violence and suicide and the use of psychotropic drugs in some cases. This research, which has been published in peer reviewed publications such as the American Journal of Psychiatry, The Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and The Journal of Forensic Science, has shown, among other things, that: certain drugs can induce mania (a psychosis which can produce bizarre, grandiose and highly elaborated destructive plans, including mass murder);. . .and certain drugs can produce an acute psychotic reaction in an individual not previously psychotic. The bill died in committee. Since that time, there have been at least 12 additional high-profile mass murders linked to the use of psychiatric drugs, about one a year.

He was dressed in full body armor with helmet and mask, exactly like a swat-team member.

This giant lie was exposed after Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont put a provision in last year\u2019s financial reform bill that forced the Fed to come clean on $9 trillion in additional emergency loans and bailout money.

This journalist suggests the reason is an Obama-era program designed to keep young criminals, particularly minorities, out of jail.

This report includes details relating to how that came about. The Broward county sheriff was involved at every step. -GEG\r\n\r\nThe puzzling reluctance of authorities to do anything about the multiple reports concerning Cruz directly contributed to the carnage at Stoneman Douglas. According to Perry this may be due to a program called PROMISE (Preventing Recidivism through Opportunities, Mentoring, Interventions, Supports & Education).\r\n\r\nAfter the December 2012 carnage at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, the Obama administration quickly moved to deploy more police in schools, allocating $44 million in grants for the effort. However, the measure was criticized by civil rights groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Justice Policy Institute, which argued that putting school discipline in hands of police would disproportionately target minority students and set them up for a life of crime.\r\n\r\nObama\u2019s Secretary of Education Arne Duncan came up with a solution: create a program that would replace discipline with counseling, and pay the police to stop arresting students for infractions. Broward County implemented the new program, called PROMISE.

Some unlucky kids might be seated next to a classmate they don\u2019t like or get lost going to the bathroom, but most kids find that all those jitters were ultimately unwarranted. That was not the case for a Toronto-area boy, however, as his first day of school this year ended with him being carted off in a police car to a hospital and being forcibly injected with drugs.\r\n\r\nDebbie Kiroff told CBC Toronto that her eight-year-old son is a normal boy in many ways; he enjoys playing with Legos, cooking and swimming. However, he also has some behavioral issues and a serious learning disability. She wasn\u2019t terribly surprised when the principal of Holland Landing Public School called her on the first day of school on September 5 to report that his behavior was \u201cescalating.\u201d He likes to run to release energy, she says, and he\u2019s fond of escaping to a frog pond on the school grounds.\r\n\r\nHowever, she was shocked by what happened next.

In addition, St. Malachy\u2019s famous Prophesy of the Popes, which predicts when the world as we know it would end, also correlates to about the same time period. The Hopi tribe, Edgar Cayce, a book attributed to Nostradamus, hell, even The History Channel\u2019s countless specials all pointed towards 12/21/12 as the beginning of the end times. The details differed, but whether you believed that Earth was due for a major cataclysm, a spiritual awakening, a religious reckoning and rapture, an alien visitation, a new dimension, or just an enlightened age, most people seemed somewhat excited that a major event was on the horizon. When the day finally arrived, we instead got something that came as a shock to many: absolutely nothing. Or so it would seem.\r\n\r\nAs skeptics, atheists, and agnostics gleefully like to point out, people have been predicting the end of the world since the beginning of recorded history and probably much longer.

Cut a straight line down one side right up to the hole in the middle. Finally, slide the pool float noodle over the rim of the bucket.\r\n\r\nYou can also cut the bottom of the bucket out, and place it over a hole that you\u2019ve dug.

According to our database of mass shootings in America going back to 1982, most of the perpetrators got their guns legally\u2014in at least 65 out of 81 cases, including Orlando.

For many centuries, the theme was: What is Deeper Reality? What does it look like? What can learn from it?\r\n\r\nThen, in the 19th century, another theme took over: How do human beings perceive reality? How do humans know what they know? What is the nature of the apparatus of human perception?\r\n\r\nFinally, as the nascent field of psychology emerged out of philosophy, the (unstated) question was: What are the factors that limit human perception and knowledge? What creates distortion in how humans view the world, other people, and themselves?\r\n\r\nThe answers were basically: neurosis and psychosis. These two general states of mind were ill-defined, and they weren\u2019t supported by reasonable science. Eventually, as medical psychiatry took over from psychology, we saw a sudden expansion of so-called mental disorders. These purported states of mind were the reasons why humans were unable to perceive and know reality objectively.\r\n\r\nHowever, even though we now have 300 (!) official mental disorders listed in the bible of psychiatry, the science behind them is sorely lacking. It is bankrupt.\r\n\r\nTherefore\nClass:\n", "input": "", "output": "1. conspiracy", "id": "C04f8f", "truncated": true}

And those are just shootings at schools. We\u2019ve seen massacres at offices, churches, theaters, concerts, malls \u2014 all the places that Americans should feel safe, not threatened.\r\n\r\nFeinstein failed to mention that the schools which have witnessed shootings have been gun-free zones, and the Democrats have been reluctant to change that.\r\n\r\nCalifornia is an excellent example of Democrats pushing to keep teacher unarmed under an attack.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats frequently Aurora movie theater attack without officially recognizing that the theater was a gun-free zone.\r\n\r\nAnother Democrat calling for a gun ban is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who called for a radical firearms ban in the United States while championing government confiscation of guns from law-abiding citizens.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, 2020 hopeful Bernie Sanders also joined the calls to ban guns in America, saying, \"This is what real action to stop gun violence looks like.

Weir explains, \u201cThe goal, since we went off the gold standard in 1971, has been to run the financial system as long and as hard as possible, sucking up all the benefits of fiat money, and there are very few attempts to slow this mess down. The idea is to put as much money as you can . . . until you have printed so much money the system implodes. This was a Nobel Prize winning paper in the 1960\u2019s called \u201cOn the Road to the Golden Age.\u201d It basically says if you have this freedom and flexibility with the monetary system, run it as hard as you can until people stop accepting the unbacked fiat money, then crash the system and go back to something safe and sound after it all blows up. . . . What they need is a big enough bubble so when it crashes, it take out all the derivatives, the malfeasance of the banks, the good guys and the bad guys and all the things going on behind the scenes. They need the bubble so big, and that\u2019s what they are doing right now is blowing the bubble so big everybody feels the effect of a crash.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen is the next crash coming? Weir says it will all unwind before \u201cthe end of this year.\u201d Weir contends, \u201cThe decision will need to be made this year. The banks will, once again, come to Congress and say we need money for a bailout. That decision will be made by the U.S. people, not by Congress, not by the Fed and not by the banks.

In the wake of the New Zealand massacre, it becomes clear that the conversation in the US to control the possession of firearms is driven by the desire to protect white American citizens of means. The US is a society that was built upon the foundations of a violent colonial and imperial system. Neither gun control advocates nor their opponents acknowledge this reality when jockeying for political influence within the U.S. state apparatus.\r\n\r\nIn the twilight of his administration, Obama shed tears, not for the victims of US-led global imperialism, but for the need to enforce gun control by executive order. The order came in the aftermath of several mass shootings that occurred in places such as Sandy Hook and San Bernardino. Obama's crocodile tears were meant to give his administration and the Democratic Party a swift public relations boost. The performance also helped draw people\u2019s attention away from the bankrupt gun control narrative that exists in the US. This pattern would repeat itself again in the March for Our Lives protests that emerged during the Trump Administration.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic Party and Republican Party dominate the discourse on gun control in the US. On the one hand, Democrats argue that gun control will prevent mass shootings from occurring. Republicans argue that gun control infringes upon the right to bear arms enshrined by the Second Amendment. Yet while gun rights activists are often cited as racist and backward, gun control advocates have escaped similar criticism.

Given these alarming numbers, many schools across the United States have adopted an absolute zero tolerance policy on firearms.\r\n\r\nOne Ohio middle school, however, took the anti-gun establishment and zero tolerance policy a little too serious and suspended a student for scrolling through Instagram and liking a picture of an airsoft gun one of his friends had posted.

The PLCAA passed by Congress in 2005 relieves weapon manufacturers from liability in gun violence crimes.\r\n\r\nWhile the court on Thursday reaffirmed that the gun maker enjoys protection under the act, it ruled that the plaintiffs, families of the nine victims of the massacre and a teacher who survived the bloodshed, are entitled to sue the companies for alleged violation of marketing rules.\r\n\r\nThe lawsuit argues that Remington violated the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA) when it aggressively promoted its semi-automatic Bushmaster XM15-E2S rifle to civilians. The plaintiffs took particular issue with Remington\u2019s marketing of high-capacity magazines.\r\n\r\nThe issue was thrust back into the center of the national gun control debate after the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting. Last month, a bill to outlaw high-capacity magazines, typically defined as magazines that are able to hold more than 10 rounds, was reintroduced in Congress.

According to Dr. Aaron Goodarzi of the University of Calgary, houses may have well over the safe exposure limit of radon gas.\r\n\r\nIn an article in the Daily Mail, Dr. Goodarzi writes that at least one in 15 homes in the U.S. contain the invisible gas.\r\n\r\nRadon, a radioactive, invisible, and colorless gas, is a major cause of lung cancer after cigarette smoke. In Canada, at least 4,000 new cases of lung cancer are attributed to radon exposure, while experts estimate 15,000 to 22,000 lung cancer deaths in the U.S. are linked to the gas.\r\n\r\nHe and his research team have been testing well over 2,300 homes in Canada for radon for years. According to the results of the testing, at least one in eight homes that were tested contained radon levels that are higher than acceptable levels. Interestingly enough, newer houses have the largest problem with radon levels.\r\n\r\nHowever, the problem lies, according to Dr. Goodarzi, with people\u2019s lack of awareness on the effects of radon gas.\r\n\r\nRadon is a radioactive gas that\u2019s invisible and contains no odor. While it naturally occurs from the breakdown of radium in the soil, the gas can seep into a building through cracks in the foundation as well as other openings.\r\n\r\nIt can be mostly found in the basement or cellars of homes, schools, and offices.

The bill contains the first congressional action on gun control since 20 children and six staff members were gunned down at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, on 14 December. But the congressional action is notable for the wrong reasons. Far from promising to shine badly needed light on the myriad unanswered questions around current policies on firearms, it instead continues restrictions on the gun-related research that is essential to wise policy-making. It is precisely the opposite of what is needed in the United States, where people murder each other with guns at about 20 times the rate in other wealthy nations.\r\n\r\nWe have been here before. After a gunman murdered 12 people and injured 58 in a Colorado cinema last July, this publication noted that the US National Rifle Association (NRA), through proxies in Congress, has since 1996 inserted restrictive language in the annual bill that funds the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The language prohibits the agency from spending any money \u201cto advocate or promote gun control\u201d (see Nature 488, 129; 2012).\r\n\r\nIn 2012, that language was extended to include all of the CDC\u2019s huge parent department, the Department of Health and Human Services, which includes the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Thus, policy development has been an important topic of interest for scholars, educators, and policy-makers. In the U.S., all states are required to adopt anti-bullying policies. Although this mandate has informed state policies since 2015, relatively little research thoroughly explores the content of these bullying policies and how it potentially relates to the prevalence of school bullying (Smith et al., 2008). The majority of the peer-reviewed research conducted on the content of school bullying policies stems from countries in the United Kingdom, such as England (e.g., Woods & Wolke, 2003; Smith, Smith, Osborn, & Samara, 2008; Smith, Kupferberg, Mora-Merchan, Samara, Bosley, & Osborn, 2012), Northern Ireland (e.g., Purdy, & Smith, 2016), or Wales (e.g., Epstein, Dowler, Mellor & Madden, 2006; Lambert, Scourfield, Smalley, & Jones, 2008). Overall, scholars have examined similar components of anti-bullying policies such as inclusion of the definition of bullying, enumeration of specific groups or student characteristics (e.g., gender, race, sexual orientation), procedures and reporting processes, and identification of various bullying behaviors (e.g., relational, verbal, physical), with similar results across contexts.

Results suggest that over the entire Transect the lateral pressure gradient force balances the sum of the centrifugal force associated with the oscillating tidal flow and the Coriolis force due to the non-tidal flow normal to the Transect. This balance is maintained without significant contribution from turbulent shear stresses.

By the time the ordeal was over, seventeen faculty members, staff members, and students lay dead, and another fourteen people were severely wounded. It was the worst school shooting in the United States since the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, which took the lives of twenty children and six adults.\r\n\r\nAt the time of writing, the motivations of the shooter are still unclear. The nineteen\u2010year\u2010old suspect had previously been expelled from Stoneman Douglas for disciplinary reasons, which were reportedly related to carrying a firearm or ammunition onto the school campus. Concerns about Cruz had also been reported to local and federal law enforcement agencies, particularly because of his history of violent behavior and his disturbing posts on social media (including a comment in a YouTube video mentioning his plans to become a \u201cprofessional school shooter\u201d).

We should be talking about San Bernardino and the 26 killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in the same breath, but for a different reason.\r\n\r\nOne of the assailants in San Bernardino used a DPMS AR-15 semiautomatic rifle; in Sandy Hook, the shooter was armed with a Bushmaster AR-15. The DPMS and Bushmaster brands are owned by the same company, a firearms conglomerate known as Remington Outdoor, formerly the Freedom Group. In its most recent annual report, Remington boasts that it is one of the largest suppliers of these guns, which it calls modern sporting rifles, to civilians \u2014 and that the company owes its leading market share position to the Bushmaster and DPMS brands.\r\n\r\nThe fact that mass shooters are attracted to Remington's product line is hardly surprising.

Responding to February\u2019s mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, participants called for an end to the stubborn political and cultural impasse that has frustrated all attempts at gun reform. But March for Our Lives suggests that a far more significant movement for democratic change is taking root.\r\n\r\nAfter the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in 2012, public policy scholar Kristin A. Goss wrote about the curious absence of a \u201cpopular movement for gun control\u201d. The failure of measures to prevent future slayings in the event\u2019s aftermath paralysed many Americans: if the killing of 20 elementary school children could not move policymakers to act, then nothing could.

Animals were exposed to nominal metal concentrations from 0.01 to 1,000 mg/L for 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, or continuously until the endpoint for the study (successful molting or death) was reached. Larvae showed greater tolerance of Cu and Zn than embryos. Under most treatment regimes, embryos and larvae were able to survive and molt in the presence of up to 100 mg/L Cu or Zn. Unexpectedly, horseshoe crabs from the more heavily polluted site (Sandy Hook Bay) were more susceptible to heavy metals than animals from a less polluted site (lower Delaware Bay). Horseshoe crab embryos and larvae were highly resistant to heavy metals in comparison to marine crustacea. The ability of Limulus embryos and larvae to survive in the presence of heavy metals implies the potential for these contaminants to be passed on to shorebirds and other predators.\nClass:\n", "input": "", "output": "0. non-conspiracy", "id": "M0839a", "truncated": false}

The 18-page plan marks the first time in five years the Obama administration has updated its policy for preventing the spread of violent groups, such as those that motivated the perpetrators of attacks in the last year in Charleston, South Carolina, San Bernardino, California, Orlando, Florida, New York and New Jersey. A self-styled white supremacist shot dead nine black people inside a historic African-American church in Charleston and the other shootings and bombs were inspired by Islamist militants, who have carried out attacks on civilians in several countries.\r\n\r\nBoth Republicans and Democrats in Congress have questioned Department of Homeland Security officials over the delay in updating its approach to countering recruitment strategies by Islamic State, which controls parts of Iraq and Syria, and other groups. Congress does not have the authority to reject the plan, but they could withhold funding to see that it is not fully implemented. Civil liberties groups, including the Council on American-Islamic Relations, have criticized the current model as one that creates distrust in Muslim communities in the United States.

A stone drops in a pond and it all ripples out. And I understand that better now than when I was younger,\" Cartaya said. \"We've lost so many people along the way: that isolation, that grief, that anger manifests in the worst possible ways.

At the time, there was little available in the way of formalized counseling for trauma survivors, and a massive stigma against getting help, experts say.\r\n\r\nMonday brought fresh grief for Cartaya and others like him who now work with trauma survivors: The father of a child killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was found dead by apparent suicide in Newtown, Connecticut, police confirmed.

To avoid any implications of partisanship, it seems best on this occasion to eschew politics in the conventional sense and to concentrate on institutional analysis not applicable to the current conflict. This discussion will therefore deal with the Supreme Court and with the Court primarily as an institution, rather than with problems of changing personnel or the political implications of particular decisions. It will assume that institutions are important in terms of their intrinsic nature and that the kind of institution to be used for a particular governmental task depends largely on the kind of task to be performed, with room for exceptions in exceptional circumstances. So it is that the Court will be presented not in isolation but as a part of the judicial system at whose apex it stands, and will be discussed in terms of the assumptions which lie back of and dictate its rituals, routines and procedures, and which have a great deal to do with determining its efficacy for the tasks allocated to it.\r\n\r\nBecause analysis of hallowed institutions and ritualized performance is often incorrectly identified with the expression of hostility or disrespect, with only deference permitted on the part of him who would leave the ritual or the institution with the stature it had when he approached it, let me emphasize that the purpose here is not to attack or to disparage but to analyze and to encourage further analysis, with creative ends in view.\nClass:\n", "input": "", "output": "0. non-conspiracy", "id": "M08fb4", "truncated": false}

The push to close the gun-show loophole in the wake of the 1999 Columbine shootings petered out, and the assault-weapon ban was allowed to expire in 2004. During Obama's presidency, former chief of staff Rahm Emanuel counseled the president to avoid the hot-button topic.\r\n\r\nBut gun-control legislation isn't impossible, Schiff said. \"There have been times in the past where we have been able to pass legislation,\" he said. \"We went through a long period where the politics of it became too problematic, but now I think we're back in a place where Congress and the president are ready to take action. I've been in Congress for a dozen years, and I've never seen the momentum move so quickly in support of responsible gun control.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, in a little-remembered episode, the Senate actually voted to close the gun-show loophole in 2004. Senators John Kerry and John Edwards, then on the Democratic presidential ticket, came off the campaign trail to vote for the proposal, contained in an amendment introduced by Republican John McCain. When the amendment passed, 53 to 46, it surprised the NRA, and the author of the bill to which it was attached, then-Senator Larry Craig, had to withdraw his own legislation to keep it from passing.\r\n\r\n\"That was when the NRA was at the peak of their power,\" said Matt Bennett of the center-left think tank Third Way, a former director of public\nClass:\n", "input": "", "output": "0. non-conspiracy", "id": "M093b5", "truncated": true}

In the aftermath of Columbine, and the many other school shootings such as Sandy Hook and Virginia Tech, parents and educators nationwide are wondering what can be done to prevent such incidents. My colleagues and I have shed new light on the correlation between increased unemployment and rising gun violence at schools through our research. As our article in Nature Human Behavior states, this correlation can be seen on the national, regional, and city level. With a direct link established between economic distress and school gun violence, there is not only a probable cause or contributing factor, but also the potential for improving job prospects and financial advancement as a mitigating factor.\r\n\r\nThe relationship between economic insecurity and gun violence in schools adds a tragic dimension to what is already known about the impact of unemployment and financial stress on families. Economic insecurity intensifies feelings of frustration, anger, fear, hopelessness, as well as a lack of safety. Now, this new research indicates that economic security, with lost hope and diminished prospects for a job, may link directly to gun violence in schools. Although there has been extensive study of school shootings, there are many contradictory claims. For example, some past studies have seen no significant increase over time, while others believe a \"copycat effect\" has led to increased frequently. Other studies have tried to identify sociological and risk factors related to shooters in hopes of understanding and preventing incidents. In the past, society looked at various potential causes as well as causality, even heavy metal music and violent videog\nClass:\n", "input": "", "output": "0. non-conspiracy", "id": "M1f6c0", "truncated": true}
